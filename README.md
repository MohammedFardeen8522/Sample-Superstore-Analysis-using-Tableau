# **Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis**

In this Superstore Sales Data Analysis project, an exploratory data analysis was performed on the Superstore Sales Data available on Kaggle. The main aim of the project is to uncover insights into the store's sales and profits trends and patterns from 2014 to 2017. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, the profits trends were visualized by states, region, category, sub-category and timeline. Additionally, top-performing products and the top customers were identified. After that, the data is displayed in 3 Power BI interactive dashboards. A region focus, a category focus and a customer focused. The analysis below provided valuable insights into the Superstore's sales and profits performance and identified areas for improvement.

My analysis was carried with Excel, SQL and finally Power BI. Excel will serve as first repository for our data, SQL will give meaning to our data and Power BI will give a clear face to our data. The following sales performance analysis will follow the 6 steps of Data Analysis which are: Goals, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Visualize and Act.

## **Goals**
we will define the business problem given to us which was interpreted as “What are the best products, regions, categories and customer segments for the Superstore to target or avoid in order to increase profitability?”

Business objectives:

How can we optimize our profits?

What are the emerging trends that we can we identify?

What are the insights we can generate to give recommendations?
